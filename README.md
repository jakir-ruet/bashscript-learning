### Overview

Scripting is an integral part of Unix and Linux-based operating systems. There are two prominent script languages such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_R._Bourne"><b>B</b>roune</a> <b>S</b>hell (<b>SH</b>) & <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Fox_(computer_programmer)"><b>B</b>roune</a> <b>A</b>gain <b>SH</b>ell (<b>BASH</b>). Both are used for interfacing the user with the operating system. First release in 1979.

### Shell

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_R._Bourne"><b>B</b>roune</a> Shell is a shell command line interpreter for computer operating systems. That works via command or instruction for the purpose of interfacing the users to the operating system.

### Script

A shell script is a file containing commands for shell. A BASH shell is simply a file containing commands for the BASH shell.

### BASH

Bash is a Unix shell and command language wrtitten by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Fox_(computer_programmer)">Brian Fox</a> for the GNU Project as free software replacement for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_R._Bourne"><b>B</b>roune</a> <b>S</b>hell. That works via command or instruction for the purpose of interfacing the users to the operating system. First release in 1989.

### <b>P</b>ortable <b>O</b>perating <b>S</b>ystem <b>I</b>nterface (<b>POSIX</b>)

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX"><b>P</b>ortable <b>O</b>perating <b>S</b>ystem <b>I</b>nterface (<b>POSIX</b>)</a> is a family of standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. It is a set of the standard operating system interfaces based on the Unix operating system.

### Difference & comparison between Shell and BASH.

| SL  | Shell                              | BASH                           |
| :-: | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
|  1  | Less enhanced systex               | More enhanced systex           |
|  2  | Array, Variable not supports       | Array, Variable supports       |
|  3  | Shebang (#!) #!/bin/sh             | Shebang (#!) #!/bin/bash       |
|  4  | It is not a PROSIX compliant shell | It is a PROSIX compliant shell |

### How to run BASH code in vscode

<ul>
   <li>Give permission to the respective file that you would like to run.</li>
   <li>./Select the file that you are run</li>
</ul>

### Path

Here, it determines the unique location of a file or directory in the system. Two type of paths shown below;

<ul>
   <li>Absolute Path</li>
   <li>Relative Path</li>
</ul>

<b>Absolute Path</b>
It is a full path specifying the location of a file or directory from the root directory to destination directory.
Example: /home/jakir/my-file.txt

<b>Relative Path</b>
The relative path of a file is its location relative to the current working directory. It never starts with a slash (/). It begins with the ongoing work directory. It is works as follows

<ul>
   <li>Single Dot (.) resolves to the current directory.</li>
   <li>Double Dot (..) resolves to the parent directory of the present work directory.</li>
   <li>Tilde (~) represents the home directory of logged in user.</li>
</ul>
