### Data Types in Bash
Bash does not have explicit data types like other programming languages (e.g., Python, C, Java). Instead, everything is treated as a string, but you can still perform `integer` `arithmetic` and work with different types of data.
- String Data (Default)
- Integer Data (Numbers)
- Floating-Point (Decimal) not support - Use `bc` or `awk` for decimal calculations.
- Boolean Data (True/False)
